# Hands-On-ML-studies-with-Mayra-Silva
Study repo based on Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras &amp; TensorFlow by Aur√©lien G√©ron (@ageron). Contains the original notebooks with my own modifications, notes, and experiments as I learn and apply ML concepts.


## Hands-On Machine Learning ‚Äì Study Notebooks

This repository contains my study notes and modified notebooks based on the book  
**Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow** by Aur√©lien G√©ron ([@ageron](https://github.com/ageron)).

The goal of this repo is to document my learning process, experiments, and personal changes while following the book.  
It is not an official version of the notebooks but rather a study companion with my own edits, comments, and explorations.


## üìò About the Book
The book provides a practical introduction to machine learning using Python‚Äôs main libraries:
- **Scikit-Learn**
- **Keras**
- **TensorFlow**

It covers both fundamental concepts and advanced deep learning techniques.

## üõ†Ô∏è What‚Äôs Inside
- Modified versions of the official notebooks  
- My personal notes and explanations  
- Extra experiments and code adjustments  
- Exercises and additional tests
